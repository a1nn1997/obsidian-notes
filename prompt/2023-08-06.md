grammerly project prompt

```
we dont need to setup postgresql as we are using docker containers
```

```
Our db schema will be:
<input_text> - table
	<sentence_id> - |uid| - unique uuid
	<raw_text> - |textfield| - with no word limit
	<corrected_text> - |textfield| - with no word limit

<rephase_paragraph>
	<sentence_id> - |foreignkey| on <sentence_id> of table <input_text> with one to many relations hop with table <input_text>
	<suggestion_text> - |textfield| - with no word limit
```



```
<step 1> we need to make changes in generated dockerfile to incorporate postgres setup 

<step 2> we need to setup docker postgres database with models, use amalbic to setup migrations and orm for fastapi
<step 3> we need to setup routes
<step 4> we need to check paragraph first in database and load data from db itself if raw text exist in database and raw text not present in database we need to perform these functions
	<functions 1> generate same paragraph with all grammer error correction similar to grammarly and save raw text and corrected text in <input_text> table and give in output
	<functions 2> than show list of paragraphs which has rephrase those paragraphs similarly to wordtune and save repharse sentences om table <rephase_paragraph> with links to table <input_text> and rephrase text in column <suggestion_text> and give in output
```


```conclusions if missed
<conclusion 1> <input_text> will have multiple <rephase_paragraphs> and instances
<conclusion 2> in ui once the correct button was called all the above steps will be pefrom with a dynamically generated 2 components one will be labelled as corrected text show corrected text. and other components will show a list of child component containing suggestion text
```


```
this is the api signature of backend api


<base_url>/correction/
method = post
payload = {
"raw_text": "..."
}

response = 
{
	"status": 201,
	"message": "suggestion from database" / "suggestion from prompt"
	"data": {
		"raw_text": "...",
		"corrected_text": "..."
		"suggestion_texts": [
			0th "...",
			1st "...",
			.
			.
			.
			nth "...",
		]
	}
}
```


```ui draft
 - textbox "take raw_text as input"
 - button "on submit call url <base_url>/correction/ witj raw_text be text present in textbox"
 - once button was clicked
 - 2 components with textbox
	 - <component one> will show type as corrected_text and difference word diffrences between raw_text and corrected text below similar to grammerly 
	 - <component two> show list of all suggestion text from 0th to nth suggestion_texts
```


```
whole code should be operated from docker containers
enable pg admin container to see all stored prompt. 
```

```use GPT4 key to peform text corrections and get text suggestions
```
