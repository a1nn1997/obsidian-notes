# basics of OOP and POP
1. Qns why need to change current system when working fine it involves risk of loosing code development efforts etc.
       1. [[legacy]] [[system]] old system exist. 
       2. [[legacy]] [[system]] rap [[legacy]] [[system]] in object# wrapper 
2. What is [[objects]]?   [[behaviour]]( functionality ) + [[attributes]]( subparts )  eg for [[oop]](classes) => [[attributes]](int list data structure)  +  [[behaviour]](methods)
       1. [[object]] [[programming]] => [[operations]] on [[data]] + [[other]] [[functionality]]
       2. access and [[control]] of [[data]] as well as [[method]] in our hand eg init and private, protected and public methods (process of restricting access called as data hiding) .
       3. [[behaviour]] (methods) + [[attributes]] (data/ data structure/ variable)  -(in same entity) - > [[encapsulation]] encapulate together .
		    1. [[Encapsulation]] is defined by the fact that objects contain both the attributes and behaviors. Data hiding is a major part of encapsulation (where data should not be visible to other classes)
		    2. Robust classes are designed with encapsulation in mind. In the next sections, we cover the concepts of interface and implementation, which are the basis of encapsulation
	    2. focus can be given to method or data without care much about objects / other operations as a whole.
       3. advantage of oop over procedural op is that the data and the operations that manipulate the data (method or attribute) are both encapsulated in the object.
       4. everything is object in oop.
       5. The behavior of an object is what the object can do. behaviors are contained in methods, and you invoke a method by sending a message to it.
       6. the [[getters]] and [[setters]] are actually properties of the [[attributes]] (java specific not in python as it was handled automatically). the [[getters]] and [[setters]] provide controlled access to an object’s data. [[Getters]] and [[setters]] are sometimes called [[accessor-methods]] and [[mutator-methods]]
       7. [[class]] is a [[blueprint/]] [[template]] for an object.      When you instantiate an object, you use a class as the basis for how the object is built.
	       eg class A():  # class
			pass
		 a1 = A()  # a1 as object with class A() as its blueprint/ template.

		 1. [[Messages]] are the [[communication]] mechanism between [[objects]]. For example, when Object A invokes a method of Object B, Object A is sending a message to Object B. Object B’s response is defined by its return value.
		 2. [[Interface]] defines the fundamental means of [[communication]] between [[objects]]. 
		 3. Each [[class]] design specifies the [[interfaces]] for the proper instantiation and operation of objects.
		 4. Any behavior that the object provides must be invoked by a message sent using one of the provided [[interfaces]].
		 5. The [[interface]] should completely describe how users of the [[class]] interact with the [[class]].
		 6. The [[interfaces]] to the [[classes]] are the [[public]] [[methods]] while the [[interfaces]] to the [[methods]] relate to how you call (invoke) them
		 7. When a [[method]] [[name]] is the same as the [[class]] and no return type is provided, the method is a special method, called a [[constructor]].
			1.Consider a [[constructor]] as the [[entry-point]] for the class, where the object is built; the constructor is a good place to perform [[initializations]] and [[start-up]] [[tasks]].
		 1. It is natural to think of [[objects]] as [[containing]] [[other]] [[objects]].
			 1. objects are often built, or composed, from other objects:This is [[composition]].
			 2.  there are only two ways to build [[classes]] from other [[classes]]: [[inheritance]] and [[composition]].

   9. Only the public [[attributes]] and [[methods]] are considered the [[interface]].The user should not see any part of the [[implementation]]—interacting with an object solely through [[class]] [[interfaces]].

1. [[procedure]] [[orriented]] [[programming]] (pop) attributes and behaviours are different based on procedure rather than clubbing behaviour and attributes together.
		1. if two system takes together part 1 send only required data with assumption part 2 know what to do with it.
		  part1   -(procedural programming)-> part2
		  [[handshaking-agreement]]  between part1 and part 2 
		2. In [[procedural]] [[languages]] the [[behavior]] is defined by [[procedures]], [[functions]], and [[subroutines]].
4. [[object]] [[orriented]] [[databases]] 
5. [[global]] [[data]] issues
        1.  so it is easy to modify data that is outside the scope of your code.
        2. This means that access to data is uncontrolled and unpredictable (that is, multiple functions may have access to the global data).
		3. because you have no control over who has access to the data, testing and debugging are much more difficult.
		4. there is no such thing as global data in an OO model. This fact provides a high amount of data integrity in OO systems.
6.  Structured programs have complex data structures, such as arrays, and so on. C++ has structures, which have many of the characteristics of objects (classes)
7.  first class diagram basic diagram which is used describe attributes for oop class contains basics only.
8. UML (Unified Modeling Language) modeling tools to create and maintain class diagrams that correspond to real code. eg
