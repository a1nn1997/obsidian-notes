## Latency vs throughput

**Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.

**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.

Generally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.

_Latency_ is the time required to perform some action or to produce some result. Latency is measured in units of time -- hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds or clock periods.

_Throughput_ is the number of such actions executed or results produced per unit of time. This is measured in units of whatever is being produced (cars, motorcycles, I/O samples, memory words, iterations) per unit of time. The term "memory bandwidth" is sometimes used to specify the throughput of memory systems.
