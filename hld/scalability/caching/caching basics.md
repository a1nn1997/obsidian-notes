 Caching involves **storing frequently accessed or computationally expensive data** in a temporary storage area (cache) closer to the users or application components. 
 By doing so, subsequent requests for the same data can be served more quickly and efficiently.

The primary goal is to reduce the load on the backend systems by serving cached data whenever possible. This approach provides several advantages:

1. Improved performance:
    
2. Reduced backend load: 
	1. Caching offloads the backend systems by serving requests from the cache instead of fetching data from the original data source or performing expensive computations. 
	2. This helps to reduce the load on databases, APIs, or other backend components, allowing them to handle a higher volume of requests.
    
3. Scalability: 
	1. Caching can contribute to system scalability by allowing the system to handle a larger number of requests without a proportional increase in backend resource requirements. 
	2. By serving cached data, the system can support higher user loads while maintaining acceptable performance levels.
    
4. Resilience: 
	1. Caching can improve the resilience of a system by acting as a buffer against temporary spikes in traffic or sudden increases in demand. 
	2. By serving cached data during peak periods, the system can continue to provide responses even if the backend systems experience limitations or temporary issues.
    

However, caching also has considerations and challenges:

1. Cache invalidation: 
	1. Keeping the cache up-to-date can be challenging, especially when the underlying data changes frequently. 
	2. Implementing efficient cache invalidation mechanisms is crucial to ensure that users receive the most recent and accurate data.
    
2. Cache consistency: 
	1. In distributed systems with multiple caches, **maintaining cache consistency** across all nodes can be complex. 
	2. Techniques such as cache coherence protocols or distributed caching strategies may be required to ensure consistent and synchronized data across the caching layer.
    
3. Cache eviction strategies: 
	1. Caches have limited storage capacity, and when the cache reaches its capacity limit, decisions must be made regarding which data to evict. 
	2. Implementing effective cache eviction strategies, such as **least recently used (LRU) or least frequently used (LFU)**, is essential to optimize cache utilization.
    
4. Cache warming: 
	1. When a cache is initially empty or purged, there can be a temporary performance dip until the cache is warmed up again. 
	2. Strategies like preloading or prefetching popular or anticipated data into the cache can mitigate this issue.
