Layer 7 Load Balancing:

1. Operates at the Application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model.
2. Makes load balancing decisions based on information available in the application layer protocols, such as HTTP headers, cookies, or URL paths.
3. Distributes traffic based on application-specific criteria, enabling more sophisticated routing and optimization.
4. Provides advanced features like content-based routing, SSL termination, session persistence, and application-aware health checks.
5. Can perform deep packet inspection to make routing decisions based on the contents of the packets.
6. Suitable for scenarios where applications require advanced routing capabilities, content-based routing, or SSL termination.
7. Offers enhanced flexibility and control over traffic distribution but may introduce additional processing overhead due to packet inspection.
8. Examples of Layer 7 load balancing solutions include application delivery controllers (ADCs), reverse proxies, and software-based load balancers that operate at the Application layer.
9. Layer 7 load balancers look at the application layer to decide how to distribute requests. This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies. Layer 7 load balancers terminate network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server. For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.

At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.
