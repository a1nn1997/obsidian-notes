Adding more machines or servers to distribute the workload and handle increased traffic or demand. 

Multiple machines or servers work together as a cluster or a group.
Each machine in the cluster shares the workload, allowing for better distribution of resources and increased overall capacity. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Scalability: 

2. Fault tolerance:

3. Load balancing: Horizontal scaling often incorporates load balancing mechanisms to evenly distribute incoming requests across the available machines. 

4. Redundancy:
5. 
However, there are considerations to keep in mind with horizontal scaling:

1. Complexity: It requires managing multiple machines, coordinating their actions, and potentially implementing distributed algorithms and communication protocols.

2. Communication overhead: 
	1. As the system expands horizontally, intercommunication between machines becomes more important.
	2. Efficient communication mechanisms and protocols must be in place to ensure coordination and data consistency across the cluster.

4. Data consistency: In distributed systems, maintaining data consistency can be challenging.  
	1. Techniques such as distributed databases, replication, or distributed caching may be necessary to ensure data integrity and consistency across the cluster.
