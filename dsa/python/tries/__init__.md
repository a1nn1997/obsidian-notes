**Problem Statement:**Â Implement a Trie Data Structure which supports the following three operations:

1. Search (word): To check if the string `word` is present in the Trie or not.
2. Insert (word): To insert a string `word` in the Trie.
3. Start With(word): To check if there is a string that has the prefix `word`.

Trie is a data structure that is like a tree data structure in its organisation. It consists of nodes that store letters or alphabets of words, which can be added, retrieved, and deleted from it in a very efficient way.

In other words, Trie is an information retrieval data structure, which can beat naive data structures like Hashmap, Tree, etc in the time complexity of its operations.
