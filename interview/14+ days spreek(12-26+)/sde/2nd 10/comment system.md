Designing a commenting system involves understanding the requirements, setting up the necessary data storage, creating efficient APIs, ensuring that the system is scalable, and implementing security measures. Let's dive into each of these steps.

### 1. **Requirements**:

- **Basic Features**: Users should be able to add comments, delete their own comments, edit their comments, reply to comments, and view comments.
  
- **Advanced Features**: Upvoting/downvoting, flagging inappropriate comments, pagination, sorting (e.g., newest, most upvoted), user mentions, and notifications.

- **Security**: Authentication and authorization, spam protection, data validation, and potentially content filtering.

### 2. **Data Storage**:

- **Database Schema**:
  - `Comments` table with fields like: `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `parent_comment_id` (for replies), and possibly `votes_count`.
  - If you're doing upvoting/downvoting, you might have a `Votes` table with fields like: `user_id`, `comment_id`, and `vote_type` (up or down).
  - For flagging, a `Flags` table: `user_id`, `comment_id`, `reason`.

- **Database Choices**:
  - Relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL are often chosen due to the structured nature of comments and their relationships. NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be used if flexible schema is desired.

### 3. **API Design**:

- `POST /comments`: To create a new comment.
- `PUT /comments/{commentId}`: To edit a comment.
- `DELETE /comments/{commentId}`: To delete a comment.
- `GET /comments?articleId={articleId}`: To fetch comments for a specific article/post. This might support pagination and sorting.
- For advanced features, you'd also have endpoints for upvoting, downvoting, flagging, and more.

### 4. **Scalability**:

- **Caching**: Consider using caching mechanisms like Redis to cache frequent comment sections. This will reduce the load on your database.
  
- **Database Scaling**: Utilize read replicas to handle increased read operations. If you anticipate a lot of write operations, consider database partitioning or sharding.

- **CDN**: If your commenting system includes media (like user avatars), serve them via Content Delivery Networks to speed up access for users globally.

### 5. **Security**:

- **Authentication**: Integrate with the main system's authentication (like OAuth or JWT) to identify users.
  
- **Authorization**: Ensure users can only edit or delete their own comments.
  
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent spam or abuse.
  
- **Content Filtering**: Integrate services to detect and filter out inappropriate content. 

- **Data Validation**: Make sure to validate incoming data to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

### 6. **User Experience**:

- **Real-time Updates**: Consider using WebSockets or similar technology for real-time comment updates, especially if it's a live event.
  
- **Notifications**: Notify users when their comment receives a reply or mention.

- **Spam Detection**: Integrate with services that help detect spam comments.

### 7. **Backup and Recovery**:

- Regularly backup your comments database to prevent data loss.
  
- Ensure you have a recovery strategy in place in case of database failures.

### 8. **Monitoring and Analytics**:

- Use monitoring tools to track API request rates, latencies, and error rates.
  
- Analytics can provide insights into popular articles (by comment count), active users, peak commenting times, and more.

Designing a commenting system can start relatively straightforward, but as you accommodate more use cases and scale, it can quickly become complex. Always design with the future in mind, making it as modular as possible to easily integrate additional features.
