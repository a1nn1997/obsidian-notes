**System Design for Avoma's Platform**

---

**High-Level Design (HLD)**:

* **User Interface**: A web and mobile frontend using React.js as described in the JD. Provides interfaces for users to schedule meetings, view meeting summaries, extract topics and action items, and manage their CRM data.

* **Backend**: A scalable server-side application built with Django for handling business logic, user management, and other core functionalities.

* **RESTful APIs**: Serves as an interface between the frontend and backend, supporting functionalities such as user authentication, data retrieval, and management of meeting summaries.

* **Data Processing Pipeline**: For real-time processing of meetings, extracting notes, topics, and action items using NLP and ML algorithms.

* **Third-Party Integrations**: Interfaces to connect with external systems like Calendars, CRM systems, and Video Conferencing tools.

**Low-Level Design (LLD)**:

* **User Interface**:
  * **Web Client**:
    * User Dashboard: Displays upcoming meetings, recent summaries, and action items.
    * CRM Integration Page: Allows users to sync their CRM data.
    * Settings: User profile, preferences, and system configurations.
  * **Mobile Client**: Offers similar functionalities as the web client but optimized for mobile view.

* **Backend**:
  * **Authentication Service**: Using JWT or OAuth for user signup, login, and session management.
  * **User Management Service**: Manages user data, preferences, and roles.
  * **Meeting Management Service**: Handles scheduling, summarization, and other meeting-related tasks.
  * **Data Processing Service**: Responsible for ML model deployments, NLP tasks, and processing meeting audio to extract summaries.

* **RESTful APIs**:
  * Endpoints for CRUD operations related to users, meetings, and CRM data.
  * Dedicated endpoints for starting/stopping data processing tasks.

* **Data Processing Pipeline**:
  * **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data streams from ongoing meetings.
  * **Data Processing**: NLP algorithms for text summarization, topic extraction, and action item identification.
  * **Data Storage**: Database systems for storing processed data (PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for logs and unstructured data).

* **Third-Party Integrations**:
  * **Calendar Integration**: APIs to sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
  * **CRM Systems**: APIs to sync with popular CRMs like Salesforce.
  * **Video Conferencing Tools**: APIs to connect with tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.

**Possible Features**:

* **Real-time Meeting Transcription**: Convert meeting audio to text in real time.
* **Automatic Meeting Scheduling**: Suggest optimal times for meetings based on participants' availability.
* **Action Item Tracker**: Track and remind users of pending action items from meetings.
* **Intelligent Search**: Allow users to search through past meetings using keywords, dates, participants, etc.
* **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights on meeting durations, participation, action item completion rates, etc.
* **Security and Privacy Features**: End-to-end encryption, GDPR compliance tools, and user data anonymization.

**Infrastructure & DevOps**:

* **Deployment**: Utilizing Docker containers for ensuring consistent deployment across development, staging, and production environments.
* **Scaling**: Employ AWS EC2 instances, potentially using auto-scaling groups to handle traffic surges.
* **Database**: Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL and AWS's MongoDB solution.
* **Storage**: AWS S3 for storing audio recordings and other static assets.
* **Serverless Computing**: AWS Lambda for certain tasks that can be offloaded from the main server.
* **Version Control**: GIT for source code management and collaboration.
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

This design provides an overview and can be detailed further based on specific requirements and constraints. It's always a good idea to revisit and refine the design as the project progresses.
