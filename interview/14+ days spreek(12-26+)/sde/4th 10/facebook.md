Designing a system as complex as Facebook requires attention to various modules, features, and non-functional requirements. Given its expansive nature, this overview will focus on a simplified, high-level design of some of the core features.

### 1. **Requirements**:

#### Functional:

1. **User Management**: User registration, authentication, profiles, and settings.
2. **Friend Management**: Add, remove, search, and suggest friends.
3. **News Feed Generation**: Display a feed of posts from friends.
4. **Posting**: Users can create posts with text, images, videos, etc.
5. **Comments and Reactions**: Users can comment on and react to posts.
6. **Notifications**: Users receive updates about interactions on their content.
7. **Messaging**: Real-time chat between users.
8. **Groups and Pages**: Create, manage, and join groups or pages.
9. **Search**: Search for users, pages, posts, etc.

#### Non-functional:

1. **Scalability**: Must support billions of users and handle massive data volume.
2. **High Availability**: Must ensure minimal downtime.
3. **Latency**: Ensure low latency for a global audience.
4. **Data Consistency**: Maintain data consistency across distributed systems.
5. **Security & Privacy**: Secure user data and content.

### 2. **System Components**:

#### a. **Web and Application Servers**: 
- Handle user requests and serve web content.

#### b. **Database Servers**: 
- Store user profiles, friendships, posts, etc.

#### c. **Cache System**: 
- In-memory caches like Redis for frequently accessed data.

#### d. **Object Storage**: 
- For storing images, videos, and other static content.

#### e. **Real-time Messaging System**: 
- Handle real-time chat, possibly using WebSockets.

#### f. **Search Engine**: 
- For fast search operations, such as Elasticsearch.

#### g. **News Feed Generation Service**: 
- Compiles posts for a user's News Feed.

#### h. **Notification Service**: 
- Handles and dispatches notifications to users.

### 3. **Data Model**:

#### a. **Users**: 
- UserID, Name, Email, Password, DOB, ProfilePic, etc.

#### b. **Posts**: 
- PostID, UserID (author), Content, Timestamp, Location, etc.

#### c. **Comments/Reactions**: 
- CommentID, PostID, UserID, Content, Type (like, love, angry), etc.

#### d. **Friends**: 
- UserID1, UserID2, FriendshipStatus, Timestamp.

#### e. **Messages**: 
- MessageID, SenderID, ReceiverID, Content, Timestamp.

#### f. **Groups/Pages**: 
- GroupID, Name, Description, Members[], Admins[], etc.

### 4. **Key Features & Processes**:

#### a. **News Feed Generation**: 
- Each user's feed is a compilation of posts from friends, prioritized by a variety of factors (recency, interactions, etc.).
- Pre-generate part of the feed and update it in real-time or on-demand.

#### b. **User Search and Friend Recommendations**: 
- Use indexed search for fast retrieval.
- Use machine learning models to suggest friends based on mutual friends, shared interests, etc.

#### c. **Real-time Messaging**: 
- Implement a pub-sub model for real-time data delivery.
- Store messages in a persistent database and use caching for recent chats.

#### d. **Notifications**: 
- Trigger notifications for interactions like comments, reactions, new friend requests, etc.
- Use a distributed message queue to handle high volumes of notifications.

### 5. **Scalability & Performance**:

1. **Sharding**: Given the large volume of data, use database sharding based on userIDs, postIDs, etc.
2. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: For serving static content like images/videos quickly across the globe.
3. **Load Balancers**: Distribute incoming traffic to prevent any single point of overloading.

### 6. **Security & Privacy**:

1. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth, Two-factor authentication, and strict authorization checks.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by rate-limiting API requests.

This high-level architecture provides a foundation for building a system like Facebook. Actual implementations would, of course, be far more intricate, taking into account numerous other features, optimizations, and nuances.
