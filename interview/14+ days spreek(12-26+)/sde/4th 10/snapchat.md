Designing a platform like Snapchat is quite comprehensive given its wide range of features and emphasis on privacy. Here's a high-level system design overview for Snapchat:

### 1. **Functional Requirements**:

1. **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profiles, settings, friend requests.
2. **Snaps**: Users can send photos/videos (snaps) to friends or post them as stories.
3. **Stories**: Snaps that can be broadcasted to a user's followers for 24 hours.
4. **Filters & Lenses**: Augmented reality (AR) overlays.
5. **Chat**: Real-time messaging.
6. **Discover**: A feed of user-generated or professionally produced content.
7. **Notifications**: Notify users about new snaps, chats, friend requests, etc.
8. **Snap Map**: See friendsâ€™ locations in real-time.
9. **Bitmoji**: Personal avatars.
10. **Memories**: Archive of user's snaps.

### 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:

1. **Scalability**: Handle millions/billions of users and their data.
2. **Low Latency**: Real-time snap and chat delivery.
3. **Availability**: Ensure high uptime.
4. **Durability**: Protection against data loss.
5. **Security & Privacy**: Ephemeral nature of content, encryption, and privacy controls.

### 3. **High-Level Architecture**:

#### a. **Web & Mobile Servers**: 
- Handle HTTP requests, interfacing with application servers.

#### b. **Application Servers**: 
- Business logic of the platform: sending/receiving snaps, chat functionality, etc.

#### c. **Database**: 
- Store user information, chat logs, friend relationships, etc.
- Could employ sharded relational databases, with NoSQL for certain use cases.

#### d. **Cache Layer**: 
- Improve access times and reduce database load.
- Redis for in-memory caching.

#### e. **Object Storage**: 
- Store images, videos, and other media. AWS S3 or similar solutions can be used.

#### f. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: 
- Deliver content closer to users, enhancing load times.

#### g. **Background Workers**: 
- Handle offline operations: notifications, cleanup tasks, etc.

#### h. **Message Queues**: 
- For managing peak loads and decoupling systems. RabbitMQ or Kafka could be used.

#### i. **AR Processing Units**:
- Dedicated servers or GPU units for AR lens and filter processing.

### 4. **Key Features & Processes**:

#### a. **Ephemeral Data Storage**:
- Most data (e.g., snaps) is ephemeral and is deleted after viewing or after 24 hours.
- Ensure data cleanup routines are efficient and reliable.

#### b. **Real-time Messaging**:
- For chats and snap delivery.
- A combination of pub-sub and long-polling/websockets can be employed.

#### c. **Image/Video Processing**:
- Compressing and storing multiple versions for different devices.
- Real-time processing for AR filters/lenses.

#### d. **Location Services**:
- For Snap Map feature.
- Must handle frequent location updates from a vast user base.

### 5. **Scalability, Performance, & Reliability**:

- **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across servers.
- **Replication**: For data reliability and read scalability.
- **Microservices**: Allows for scalability of specific functionalities.
- **Backup**: Regular data backup and recovery testing.

### 6. **Security & Privacy**:

1. **Data Encryption**: In transit and at rest.
2. **Secure Snap Delivery**: Ensure snaps are viewed by the intended recipient only and are deleted post-viewing.
3. **Monitoring**: Detect and mitigate malicious activity.

This is a very high-level overview. In a real-world scenario, each module would be further detailed, and numerous other considerations and optimizations would be taken into account.
