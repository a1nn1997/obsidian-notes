Designing a system like Netflix is quite an intricate process. Netflix is a massive distributed system that offers streaming video-on-demand to millions of users worldwide. Here's a high-level architecture followed by a more detailed design:

### High-Level Design:

1. **User Interface (Frontend)**:
   - Web Application (for browser users)
   - Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)
   - TV Apps (for smart TVs)
   - APIs for integration with third-party platforms

2. **Backend Servers**:
   - API Servers for handling client requests.
   - Streaming Servers for delivering video content.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Databases to store user data, video metadata, recommendations, etc.
   - Large scale distributed file systems or blob storage for video storage.

4. **Other Components**:
   - Authentication and Authorization service
   - Recommendation Engine
   - CDN (Content Delivery Network) for caching content closer to users
   - Analytics Service for monitoring and logging user activity

### Low-Level Design:

1. **Search**:
   - Use a distributed search system like Elasticsearch for quick searching of movies and series.
   - Maintain an updated index of all video metadata.

2. **Video Serving**:
   - Videos are stored in different resolutions and bit rates. The appropriate version is served based on user's bandwidth.
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming like MPEG-DASH or HLS to adjust video quality on-the-fly.
   - Videos are split into small chunks and served to the client, where they're stitched together.

3. **Authentication**:
   - JWT or OAuth for token-based authentication.
   - SSO (Single Sign-On) if integrating with third-party services.

4. **Encryption**:
   - Video content is DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected to prevent piracy.
   - Use HTTPS for data in transit.
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.

5. **DNS Lookup**:
   - Use a service like Route 53 to manage DNS and direct users to the nearest server or data center.
   - Implement geolocation-based DNS resolution to direct users to the closest content server.

6. **Caching**:
   - Use a CDN like Akamai or CloudFront to cache video content closer to the user.
   - Apply in-memory databases like Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data like top movies, user sessions, etc.
   - Cache movie thumbnails and metadata at edge locations.

7. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Use machine learning models trained on user's watch history, likes, and preferences.
   - Collaborative filtering for suggesting movies based on what similar users have liked.

8. **Scalability & Performance**:
   - Horizontal scaling by adding more servers during high demand.
   - Use Load Balancers to distribute incoming traffic.
   - Database sharding and replication for improved performance and redundancy.

9. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Regular backup of databases and critical services.
   - Have disaster recovery plans in place.

10. **Security**:
   - Rate limiting and DDOS protection mechanisms.
   - Regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.
   - Role-based access control for internal systems and administrative interfaces.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Microservices Architecture**: Given the scale and complexity, using a microservices architecture can help in independently scaling and deploying different functionalities of Netflix.
  
- **Global Reach**: Netflix is a global platform. It requires region-specific content licensing, content libraries, and user interfaces in multiple languages.
  
- **Personalization**: Every user's Netflix home screen might look different due to a high level of personalization based on user behavior.

Again, this is a foundational design for a platform like Netflix. The actual system has many additional complexities, optimizations, redundancies, and features that come from years of evolving the system.
