Designing a system like Jira, a widely-used project management and issue tracking system, requires attention to both functionality and scalability. Hereâ€™s a high-level architecture followed by a more detailed low-level design:

### High-Level Design:

1. **User Interface (Frontend)**:
    - **Web Application**: Using frameworks like React or Angular.
    - **Mobile Application**: Native apps for Android and iOS for on-the-go access.
    - **APIs**: For third-party integrations and bots.

2. **Backend Servers**:
    - **API Servers**: Handle requests from clients and perform CRUD operations.
    - **WebSocket Servers**: For real-time updates and notifications.

3. **Data Storage**:
    - **Databases**: Store project details, user data, issue metadata, comments, etc.
        - Relational DBs (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data.
        - NoSQL DBs (e.g., MongoDB) for logs, activity streams, etc.
    - **File Storage**: Store attachments and media.
    - **Search Engine**: For quick searching through issues (e.g., Elasticsearch).

4. **Other Components**:
    - **Notification Service**: Email notifications, in-app notifications.
    - **Authentication Service**: User sign-ups, logins, OAuth, and role-based access control.
    - **Background Job Service**: For long-running tasks like batch operations on issues.

### Low-Level Design:

1. **User Management**:
    - **Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, OAuth support, two-factor authentication.
    - **User Profiles**: Manage profile info, notification settings, and access tokens for third-party integrations.

2. **Project and Issue Management**:
    - **Projects**: Creation, categorization (by teams or departments), settings.
    - **Issues**: CRUD operations, assignees, priorities, statuses, labels, epics, sprints, etc.
    - **Workflows**: Define custom workflows for issue lifecycles.
    - **Comments & Attachments**: Allow adding comments to issues and attaching files.

3. **Collaboration**:
    - **Boards**: Kanban and Scrum boards for visual management.
    - **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket to keep boards and issue lists updated in real-time.
    - **Mentions**: Notify users by mentioning them in comments/issues.

4. **Search & Reporting**:
    - **Advanced Search**: Filter by various parameters (assignee, label, sprint, etc.).
    - **Reports & Dashboards**: Visualization of project progress, burn-down charts, etc.
    - **Activity Streams**: Logs of all activity in a project.

5. **Integrations & Extensions**:
    - **APIs**: RESTful APIs for third-party integrations.
    - **Marketplace**: Allow third-party apps/extensions to integrate with Jira.

6. **Scalability & Performance**:
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers as the user base grows.
    - **Sharding & Partitioning**: Distribute the database to ensure quick reads/writes.
    - **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data, like popular issues or project summaries.

7. **Backup & Recovery**:
    - **Data Backup**: Regularly back up the database.
    - **Disaster Recovery**: Mechanisms in place to restore service quickly in case of failures.

8. **Security**:
    - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
    - **Role-based Access Control**: Define what actions users can take based on their roles in a project.
    - **Audit Logs**: Log all sensitive operations for review and compliance.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Customizability**: One of Jira's strengths is its customizability, allowing teams to define custom fields, workflows, etc.
- **Bulk Operations**: Operations like bulk edit, bulk transition, and others should be done asynchronously using background jobs to not block the main application.
- **Permissions & Visibility**: Complex permissions might be required to restrict issue visibility within teams or departments.
- **Notifications**: Intelligent notification systems are necessary, so users are informed without being overwhelmed.

Again, this is a foundational overview of building a system like Jira. The real-world system involves many additional complexities, optimizations, and features.
