Designing a system like Google Maps, one of the world's most widely-used map services, is a challenging endeavor. Given the context of my "experience", here's a detailed system design overview:

### **1. Requirements**:

- **Functional**:
  - Map viewing for any location globally.
  - Real-time turn-by-turn navigation.
  - Traffic information.
  - Location search and point of interest (POI) discovery.
  - Satellite and street view.
  - Public transit, walking, and cycling directions.
  - User location tracking and sharing.
  - Map customization and embedding.
  
- **Non-functional**:
  - Scalability to handle billions of users and queries.
  - Low-latency response for user queries.
  - Real-time updates (e.g., traffic).
  - Data consistency and integrity.

### **2. System Components**:

#### a. **Tile Servers**:
- Maps are divided into tiles for efficient rendering and serving. These servers store and serve tiles to users.

#### b. **Routing Servers**:
- Handle real-time navigation and pathfinding using algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.

#### c. **Search Servers**:
- Responsible for location searches, geocoding, and reverse geocoding.

#### d. **Traffic Servers**:
- Collect, process, and serve real-time traffic data.

#### e. **Data Collection System**:
- Gather map data from satellites, Street View cars, user contributions, and more.

#### f. **Database Servers**:
- Store vast amounts of geographical data, POIs, user data, etc.

#### g. **User Location Servers**:
- Handle real-time location updates from user devices.

#### h. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
- Cache and deliver map tiles and other static assets closer to users for faster load times.

### **3. Key Design Considerations**:

#### a. **Data Collection**:
- Google Maps continuously collects data. Satellites, Street View cars with 360-degree cameras, airplanes, user contributions, and data purchases from third-party providers all contribute to the map data.

#### b. **Scalability**:
- The system must be built for global scale. Using techniques such as sharding, partitioning, and replication is essential. 

#### c. **Data Freshness**:
- With changing roads, landmarks, and more, keeping data fresh is crucial. The system should prioritize frequent updates and allow for easy integration of new data.

#### d. **User Privacy**:
- User location data is sensitive. It's essential to anonymize and protect this data rigorously.

#### e. **Low Latency**:
- For real-time navigation, especially in dense urban areas, low latency is a must. Efficient algorithms, caching, and edge locations play a role here.

#### f. **Extensibility**:
- Maps can be integrated into other services (e.g., ride-sharing apps, restaurant reviews). Providing a robust API for third-party developers is necessary.

### **4. Data Flow**:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Street View cars, satellites, and other sources send data to the data collection system.
   
2. **Map Generation**:
   - Raw data is processed, cleaned, and converted into map tiles. These tiles are stored and served via the CDN.
   
3. **User Query**:
   - Users can search for locations or ask for directions. These requests go to the search servers and routing servers respectively.
   
4. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Traffic servers process real-time data to provide updates on traffic conditions, road closures, etc.

5. **Rendering**:
   - Client devices retrieve map tiles and other relevant data, rendering the maps locally.

### **5. Future Considerations**:

Given the context of experience, future considerations might include better AR integration for walking directions, improved AI for predicting traffic patterns, and more advanced integration with smart cities for real-time data on things like parking availability.

The design provided here is a high-level overview of a very complex system. Real-world implementation would involve handling numerous challenges and details across the stack. However, this blueprint can serve as a foundational starting point.
