Ah, Calendly! Calendly is an online appointment scheduling software. Let's delve into designing a high-level system similar to Calendly based on the experience I've amassed over the years.

### **1. Requirements**:

#### **Functional**:
- User registration and profile management.
- Set availability preferences.
- Integration with existing calendars (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook).
- Generate unique meeting links.
- Notify users about scheduled appointments (email, SMS).
- Time zone support.
- Different types of meetings (15-min, 30-min, 1-hour).
- Recurring meetings.

#### **Non-functional**:
- Scalability.
- High Availability.
- Responsive UI.
  
### **2. High-Level Design**:

#### **a. Frontend**:
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to sign up, set availability, view scheduled meetings, etc.
- **Mobile App**: Native applications for major platforms.

#### **b. Backend**:
- **API Servers**: Handle incoming requests.
- **User Database**: Store user profiles, hashed passwords, user-specific settings, etc.
- **Meetings Database**: Store information on scheduled meetings, recurring meeting data, etc.
- **Availability Service**: Manages user availability slots.
- **Notification Service**: Sends out email/SMS notifications.
- **Integration Service**: Interfaces with third-party calendars.
- **Timezone Service**: Ensures correct time translation across different time zones.

#### **c. Third-Party Services**:
- **Email Providers**: For sending out notifications.
- **SMS Gateway**: To send SMS notifications if required.
- **OAuth Providers**: Allow sign-in through Google, Microsoft, etc., and facilitate calendar integrations.
  
### **3. Workflow**:

1. **User Registration**: A user signs up using an email/password or through OAuth.
2. **Set Availability**: The user sets their preferred time slots when they're available for meetings.
3. **Integration with Calendars**: If a user connects an external calendar, the system fetches the existing events and blocks out those times.
4. **Generate Meeting Link**: A unique link is generated which the user can share.
5. **Booking a Slot**: Another user clicks on the link, sees available slots (considering time zones), and books a time. This updates both Calendly and any integrated external calendar.
6. **Notifications**: Both parties receive an email/SMS reminder.
7. **Update/Cancel Meeting**: Either party can update or cancel the meeting through the interface, which then sends out a notification.

### **4. Scalability & Performance**:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: The system should be designed to handle an increasing number of users and appointments. Using load balancers in front of API servers can help distribute the traffic. 
- **Database Sharding**: As the number of appointments and users grow, sharding the database based on userIDs or geographic location can be beneficial.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for user availability and meeting slots using solutions like Redis to speed up retrieval times.

### **5. Security & Privacy**:

- Secure data in transit using HTTPS.
- Store hashed passwords using algorithms like bcrypt.
- Ensure that integration with external calendars respects user privacy and accesses only necessary data.
- Use OAuth tokens and refresh them regularly for integrations.

### **6. Future Considerations**:

- **Group Meetings**: Allow multiple users to schedule a common time slot.
- **Analytics**: Provide users with insights on their meeting patterns.
- **Plugins**: For direct integration with video conferencing tools or CRM systems.

This design outlines a basic architecture for a scheduling tool like Calendly. Specific implementations would need to consider more detailed aspects like error handling, rate limiting, database indexing, etc., along with compliance and regional-specific requirements.
